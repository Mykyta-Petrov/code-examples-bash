# DocuSign Bash Code Examples


## Introduction
This repo includes a Bash command-line application to demonstrate:


## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see the [Required Scopes section](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth).

1. **Use embedded signing.**

   [Source](./eg001EmbeddedSigning.sh)
   This example sends an envelope, and then uses embedded signing for the first signer.
   With embedded signing, the DocuSign signing is initiated from your website.
1. **Request a signature by email (Remote Signing).**

   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg002SigningViaEmail.sh)
   The envelope includes a pdf, Word, and HTML document.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **List envelopes in the user's account.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg003ListEnvelopes.sh)
1. **Get an envelope's basic information.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg004EnvelopeInfo.sh)

   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg005EnvelopeRecipients.sh)
   Includes current recipient status.
1. **List an envelope's documents.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg006EnvelopeDocs.sh)

   Binary transfer is 33% more efficient than using Base64 encoding.
1. **Use embedded sending.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg011EmbeddedSending.sh)
   Embeds the DocuSign web tool (NDSE) in your web app to finalize or update
   the envelope and documents before they are sent.
1. **Embedded DocuSign web tool (NDSE).**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg012EmbeddedConsole.sh)
1. **Use embedded signing from a template with an added document.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg013AddDocToTemplate.sh)
   This example sends an envelope based on a template.
   In addition to the template's document(s), the example adds an
   additional document to the envelope by using the
   [Composite Templates](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/features/templates#composite-templates)
   feature.
1. **Payments Example.**
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg014CollectPayment.sh)

1. **Set envelope tab values.**
   The example creates an envelope and sets the initial values for its tabs (fields). Some of the tabs
   are set to be read-only, others can be updated by the recipient. The example also stores
   metadata with the envelope.
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg016SetTabValues.sh)
1. **Set template tab values.**
   The example creates an envelope using a template and sets the initial values for its tabs (fields).
   The example also stores metadata with the envelope.
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg017SetTemplateTabValues.sh)
1. **Get the envelope custom field data (metadata).**
   The example retrieves the custom metadata (custom data fields) stored with the envelope.
   [Source](./examples/eSignature/eg018EnvelopeCustomFieldData.sh)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured for authentication to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the API Username GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of  

   http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback  

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as   
   
   {base_url}/authorization-code/callback   
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.  
   
1. [Git Bash command line](https://gitforwindows.org/), macOS Terminal, or Linux shell  


### Installation steps
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 3 as it was automatically performed for you.

1. Extract the Quickstart ZIP file or download or clone the code-examples-bash repository.
1. In your command-line environment, switch to the folder:  
   `cd <Quickstart folder name>` or `cd code-examples-bash`
1. To configure the launcher for [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) authentication, create a copy of the file config/settings.example.txt and save the copy as config/settings.txt.
   1. Add your integration key. On the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey) page, under **Apps and Integration Keys**, choose the app to use, then select **Actions** > **Edit**.
